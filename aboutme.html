  <p>
 I love being careless with my self and others around me.
 I love skateboarding through airports while I’m being book high paying jobs
in foreign countries. I like being cut from a different fabric.
I love being unfiltered with my only responsibility being to create.
I love the complexity of the world around me & how I find it interesting
& not scary. I love that no one in my crew has to worry about waking up
early for school or a job. I love being something that I wasn’t suppose
to be. I love my girls loyalty & acceptance. I love wearing the same
shorts for 2 weeks in Hawaii & flying into a city in ripped jeans & all black.
I love having split personalities & taste. I love Music & making
videos of the weird shit me and my friends do. I love that just being
myself I stick out and get looked at differently. I love not having
any reference of time or day. I love not giving back to the government
& my country. I love having passion & addiction. I love meeting
 people that are more than surface deep. I love learning & being a
minimalist. I love people with artistic value that make my ADHD
sustainable. I love adrenaline and release. I love how my words can
inspire or offend & live under your skin. I’m probably selfish but
 at least I’m honest I think most of all I love not giving a fuck.
